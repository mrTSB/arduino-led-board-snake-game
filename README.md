Created by Tanvir Bhathal

To run this program physically connect to the arduino and update the port and baudrate in server.py.

Then run python server.py after installing correct pip packages from imports at the top of this file.

Then open the localhost and play snake. If you arduino is connected to the proper LED board as pictured, it will show the game on the LEDs.
